## Hotel Booking System

>A simple hotel booking system which keeps track of the rooms in a hotel.
>A guest can book a room for individual nights and the booking system maintains the state of these bookings.
>Guests are identified by their surname which, for the purposes of this exercise, can be considered unique.
>Rooms are identified by a unique number taken from an arbitrary, potentially non- sequential set of numbers.
>For example, a hotel might have four rooms {101, 102, 201, 203}.
>The booking system may be used by a number of hotel staff at once, so your implementation must be thread-safe.
>There is no need to write an interactive harness or command-line interface. Simply call your code from a main method or unit test to demonstrate it works.    There is no need to implement a persistent store.
